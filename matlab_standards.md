# Standards

# Naming Conventions

This section describes recommendations for naming conventions.

## Name Shadowing

**Description:** Functions and variables **MUST NOT** shadow Mathworks-shipped functionality or other code. This includes MATLAB files (.m, .p, .mlapp, .mlx), mex-files (.mexw32 etc.) and Simulink files (.mdl, .slx).

**Rationale:** Shadowing code can result in unexpected behaviour, because it is unclear and not properly defined for example what function is called when multiple ones share the same name.

## Units

**Description:** Variable names **MUST** be documented, either in the variable name, or as end-of-line comments in square brackets. Prefer end-of-line comments if addition to the variable name will make it excessively long.

**Rationale:** Maintain readability by using concise variable names.

DO:
```matlab
time_min = 2; 
time_s = 120; 
acceleration = 1000; % [mm/s^2] 
```	
DON'T:
```matlab
time = 2; 
accelerationInMillimetersPerSecondSquared = 1000;
```
		
## Negated Boolean Names

**Description:** Variable names **SHOULD NOT** include the word not.

**Rationale:** Readability decreases when variables have negated boolean names, especially in combination with the ~ operator.

DO:
```matlab
if isValid && ~isFound 
    error('My error message.') 
end 
```
DON'T:
```matlab
if ~notValid && isNotFound 
    error('My error message.') 
end 
```
## Descriptive Names

**Description:** Names for functions, classes, packages and variables **MUST** be precise and descriptive.

**Rationale:** This increases the readability of the code.

DO:
```matlab
function tk = convC2k(temp)
```	
DON'T:
```matlab
function temperatureK = convertCelsiusToKelvin(temperatureC) 
```		
## The 'n' Prefix

**Description:** The prefix n **SHOULD** be used for variables that represent a number of things. The prefix **SHOULD NOT** be used for other purposes, and other prefixes for representing the number of things **SHOULD NOT**.

**Rationale:** Variables starting with this prefix can easily be identified.

DO:

	nFiles 
	nCars 
	nLines 
	
DON'T:

	numberOfFiles 
	nrCars 
	lineCount

## Name Length

**Description:** Variable names should be at most 32 characters long. Function names should be at least 3 and at most 32 characters long.

**Rationale:** Names shall be descriptive, so should not be too short. However, variable names can sometimes be single characters (x, y) and still be descriptive. Names that are too long can reduce readability because they introduce long lines of code.

DO:
	
	maxData = max(data); 
    

DON'T

    maximumValueOfTheEntireSetOfDataPoints = max(data);

## Loop Iterator Naming

**Description:** Iterator variable names **SHOULD** be at least 3 characters long. In nested for-loops, the starting letters of the iterator names **SHOULD** be subsequent letters in the alphabet.

**Rationale:** Iterator variables of for-loops are easily distinguishable from other variables by using these prefixes.

DO:

	for iNode = 1 : 10 
		for jPoint = 1 : 3 
       	myGraph(iNode).plotIt(jPoint); 
    	end 
	end 

DON'T:

	for nodeIdx = 1 : 10 
    	for j = 1 : 3 
       	myGraph(nodeIdx).plotIt(j); 
    	end 
	end   

## Parent / Child Name Redundancy

**Description:** Names of fields and properties **SHOULD NOT** contain their parent struct or object's name.

**Rationale:** When referenced, the fields and properties can have the same phrase multiple times in a row, which is unnecessary.

DO:

	Beam.thickness 
	chair.weight 

DON'T:

	Beam.beamThickness 
	chair.weightOfChair
	

## Names to Avoid

**Description:** Names of classes, functions, variables, properties and struct fields **SHOULD NOT** start with temp, my and they **SHOULD NOT** have names such as myClass, testFunction, etc.

**Rationale:** Names like these do not properly indicate what the class, function or variable is for.

In particular: 

	myClass 
	my_Class 
	TheClass 
	myFunction 
	myFunc 
	my_function 
	TheFunc 
	myVar 
	my_var 
	theVar 
	myProp 
	my_prop 
	temp 
	tmp 
	test 
	
## Function Names Document Their Use

**Description:** The names of functions **MUST** document their use.

**Rationale:** By choosing a clear and descriptive name, the code becomes more readable.

DO:

	model_rMatGet 
	control_bpmGet 
	util_gaussFit 
	gui_sliderControl  

DON'T:

	modelFunction 

## Function Name Construction

**Description:** Function names **SHOULD** consist of a verb (action) followed by a noun (direct object). For class methods, the direct object may be omitted if it is redundant. 

**Rationale:** This way it is more likely to be clear what the function does and if there is no suitable name following this guideline, (for example because the function does more than one thing) the function may have to be refactored.

DO:

	getPosition
	findOutlier
	multiplyNumbers
	updateModel
	getTwiss
	standardizeMagnet
	checkConvergence

DON'T:

	rMat 
	gauss 
	bpms 
	sliderstuff 


## Casing (General)

**Description:** Variables, functions, classes, and other MATLAB objects **MUST** each use a consistent casing style throughout a script.

**Rationale:** Consistent casing increases readability and maintainability.

**Types of Casing:**

	* b (single lowercase letter) 
	* B (single uppercase letter) 
	* lowercase 
	* lower_case_with_underscores 
	* UPPERCASE 
	* UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES 
	* CapitalizedWords (or CapWords, or CamelCase ) 
	* Acryonyms should retain caps 
	* mixedCase (differs from CapitalizedWords by initial lowercase character!) 
	* Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores 

## Constant Casing

**Description:** Constant variable names **MUST** be written in all-caps with underscores separating the words (UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES). 

**Rationale:** Enforcing this kind of casing easily distinguishes constants from actual variables.

## The 'is' Prefix

**Description:** The is prefix **SHOULD** be used for functions returning logical values or properties and variables holding logical values.

**Rationale:** This increases the readability of the code as it is clear from the name.


## Abbreviations

**Description:** Variable names **SHOULD NOT** contain abbreviations; except for idiomatic abbreviations commonly used at SLAC. (Found in SLAC Speak)

**Rationale:** Maintain readability by not abbreviating words in your variable names. Common acronyms are allowed.

DO:

	arrivalTime 
	bpmCharge 
 
COMMON EXCEPTIONS: 

	bpm 
	toro 
	xcor 
	ycor 
	bdes 
	
DON'T:

	arrTim 
	bpmC
	
	
## The 'Test' Suffix

**Description:** The suffix "Test" **SHOULD** only be used for unit test filenames.

**Rationale:** This increases the readability of the code as it is clear from the name of the file that it is a unit test file.

# Layouts and Comments

This section describes recommendations for code layout and comments.

## Comment Usage

**Description:** All code **MUST** use comments to explain code functionality. Comments should explain what the code does, how it works, and why it is performing this function. 

**Rationale:** Descriptive comments make it easier to read code. 

## Comment Content

**Description:** Comments **MUST NOT** use the same terminology as the code. Use different words for describing what a particular object is, or for what a piece of code does. 

**Rationale:** Comments that simply restate the code in plain English do not help explain what the code is doing. 

DO:

	BPM_x = 12; % horizontal position 
 
	% find where the horizontal difference orbit is within defined range by iterating through  
	% the difference orbit array by BPM, and comparing the to the acceptance difference of 0.1  
	% in order to see where the orbit deviates horizontally. 
	in_range = false(nBPMS, 1); 
	for iBPM = 1:nBPMS 
		if diff_orbit_x(iBPM) < 0.1 
			is_in_range(iBPM) = True; 
		end 
	end 

DON'T:

	BPM_x = 12; % x BPM coordinate 
	 
	% find x BPMs in range 
	in_range = false(nBPMS, 1); 
	for iBPM = 1:nBPMS 
		if diff_orbit_x(iBPM) < 0.1 
			Is_in_range(iBPM) = True; 
		end 
	end 

## Comment Frequency

**Description:** Comments **SHOULD** be used at least every 15 lines. 

**Rationale:** This rule helps to avoid going too long without commenting code. 

## Sign and Date Comments

**Description:** Comments with a date and signature **MAY** be used when adding code to an existinf file.

**Rationale:** This ensures that other code maintainers have access to information about the code history regardless of how version control is deployed. 

## Comment Blocks

**Description:** Comment blocks **SHOULD NOT** be used.

**Rationale:** Consistent comment syntax improves readability.

DO:

	% This is a comment. 
	% This is also a comment. 

DON'T:

	%{ This is a comment. 
	This is also a comment. 
	%}

## Function Indentation

**Description:** Functions **SHOULD** be indented on the root level of a file.

**Rationale:** Consistent indentation improves readability.

DO: 

	function computeWeight(in) 
   		weight = 2 * in; 
	end 

DON'T:

	function computeWeight(in) 
	weight = 2 * in; 
	end 

 ## Whitespace in Statements

 **Description:** The following operators **SHOULD** be surrounded with spaces: = : ^ == <= >= < > ~= & &&  | ||  + - * .* /  A space **SHOULD NOT** be used between the unary minus-sign and its operand. 

**Rationale:** Whitespace around operators often leads to improved readability. As an exception, do not use spaces around the equals signs when using the Name=Value syntax introduced in MATLAB R2021a. 

DO:

	isValid = (y > 0) && (x == -1); 
 
DON'T:

	isValid=(y>0)&&(x==-1);

## Whitespace in Characters

**Description:** Commas, semicolons and keywords (for, while, if etc.) **SHOULD** be followed by a space unless at the end of the statement. 

**Rationale:** A clear separation of keywords from other code improves readability. 

DO:

	while ismember(x, [3, 5, 7, 11, 13]) 
    		x = x + 2; 
	end
 
DON'T

	while(ismember(x, [3,5,7,11,13])) 
	    x = x + 2; 
	end
 
## Line Length

**Description:** Lines **SHOULD** be no more than 120 characters long, including comments. When possible, keep lines shorter than 80 chracters long. 

**Rationale:** A line of code should fit on a screen. Long lines of code are difficult to interpret and generally indicate great complexity.

DO:

	theText = ['Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. ', ... 
	            'Ut luctus arcu ex, at viverra nibh malesuada ac. Proin vel arcu leo.']; 

DON'T

	theText = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Ut luctus arcu ex, at viverra nibh malesuada ac. Proin vel arcu leo.';

## Indentation Length

**Description:** Indentation **SHOULD** be four spaces long. This is the default setting in the MATLAB editor. 

**Rationale:** Using an adequate and consistent number of spaces for indentation improves readability and prevents unnecessary changes when others work on the code. 

DO:

	if x > 0 
	    if x < 2 
	        disp(x) 
	    end 
	end 

DON'T

	if x > 0 
	 if x < 2 
	   disp(x) 
	 end 
	end

## Comments on Poorly Written Code

**Description:** Comments **SHOULD NOT** be used to justify or mock poorly written code. Write proper code that requires no justification instead. 

**Rationale:** Readability will be improved if issues with the code are fixed immediately instead of documented in the comments. 

DO:

	x = 2; 
	y = 3 * x + z;  
	 
	z = [1, 23, 8.1] * (x ^ 3.1415) * sqrt(y); 

DON'T

	x = 2; 
	 
	% FIXME: This piece of ugly code is copied from StackExchange. 
	z=[1,23,8.1]*(x^3.1415)*sqrt(y);

## Commas in Rows

**Description:** Commas **SHOULD** be used to separate elements in a row. Place the comma directly after the element. 

**Rationale:** This improves readability, especially in arrays of strings or character vectors. 

DO: 

	fig.Position    = [0, 1000, 1.5, 130]; 
	saying          = ['An apple a ', period, ' keeps the doctor away.']; 
 
DON'T: 

	fig.Position    = [0 1000 1.5 130]; 
	saying          = ['An apple a ' period ' keeps the doctor away.']; 

## Line Continuation with Operators

**Description:** Binary operators **SHOULD** be placed in multi-line statements at the start and not at the end of the line. 

**Rationale:** By placing binary operators at the start of the line, it is immediately clear what the line does. 

DO: 

	isDone = isImplemented ... 
	    && isTested ... 
	    && isDocumented; 
     
DON'T: 

	isDone = isImplemented && ... 
	    isTested && ... 
	    isDocumented; 

## Methods/Properties Blocks with Duplicate Attributes

**Description:** Multiple properties and methods blocks with equal attribute values **SHOULD** be combined into one. Do not set attributes to their default values. 

**Rationale:** Having multiple blocks with the same attributes is unnecessary and decreases the readability of classdef files. 

DON'T

	classdef Rocket 
	    properties (Access = public, Hidden = false, Constant) 
	        Fuel = "Nuclear" 
	    end 
	     
	    properties (Constant = true) 
	        Capacity = 2 
	    end 
	end

DO

	classdef Rocket 
	    properties (Constant) 
	        Fuel = "Nuclear" 
	        Capacity = 2 
	    end 
	end 
 
## Whitespace at the End of a Line

**Description:** White space **SHOULD NOT** be used at the end of a line of code unless it is followed by a comment. 

**Rationale:** This prevents smart-indenting a file from inducing changes to those lines. 

## Help Text

**Description:** Header comments **SHOULD** be written with text markup to provide user documentation useful both in-file and when using the help and lookfor functions.

**Rationale:** This increases readability, and makes the code more likely to be found and less likely to be reinvented. 

DO:

	LINK TO HEADER EXAMPLE

DON'T:

	function [avg, maxSize] = measureSize(obj, dim) 
		avg = mean(obj.Size, dim); 
		maxSize = max(obj.Size, dim); 
	end
 
## Whitespace Around Blocks of Code

**Description:** Coherent blocks of code **SHOULD** be separated by one or more blank lines. 

**Rationale:** Increases the readability of the code. 

DO:

	% Shift to origin. 
	deltaX = mean(xIn); 
	xOutc = xIn - deltaX; 
	 
	% Calculate scaling. 
	scalingFactor = newZ / currentZ; 
	xOut = xOut .* scalingFactor; 
	 
	% Shift back. 
	xOut = xOut + deltaX; 

DON'T

	deltaX = mean(xIn); 
	xOut = xIn - deltaX; 
	scalingFactor = newZ / currentZ; 
	xOut = xOut .* scalingFactor; 
	xOut = xOut + deltaX;

## Correct Spelling

**Description:** Correct spelling and punctuation **SHOULD** be used in comments. Write in complete sentences, starting with a capital letter and ending in a period. 

**Rationale:** This increases the readability of code. Error-strewn and poorly constructed comments reflect on the code they accompany. 

DO:

	% Get the scaling factor. 
	scalingFactor = newZ / currentZ; 
	xOut = xOut * scalingFactor; % Now rescaled.  

DON'T:

	% get sclaing factor 
	scaling_factor = new_z / current_z; 
	x_out = x_out * scaling_factor; % now recslaed


## Align Struct Definition

**Description:** When defining a struct, thenames and values of the struct fields **SHOULD** be aligned. 

**Rationale:** This improves readability of the code by making it clearer what fields are defined and by what values. 

DO:

	s = struct(... 
	    "name",     "Albert", ... 
	    "age",      2021 - 1979, ... 
	    "isValid",  ismember("Albert", allNames)) 
     
DON'T:

	s = struct("name", "Albert", "age", 2021 - 1979, "isValid", ismember("Albert", allNames)); 

## End Keyword

**Description:** Functions **MUST** conclude with the "end" keyword.

**Rationale:** Using the "end" keyword makes it easier to match indentations in code organization. 

# Statements and Expressions

## Constant Definitions

**Description:** Constant definitions **SHOULD** be placed at the top of the function, after defining global/persistent variables. For classes, constant definitions **SHOULD** exist in a separate file.

**Rationale:** Consistent constant definition allows for easy identification.

DO:

	function testConstants(x) 
		MAX_Z = 100; 
		 
		y = 3 * x; 
		z = min(y, MAX_Z); 
	end 
 
DON'T:

	function testConstants(x) 
		y = 3 * x; 
		MAX_Z = 100; 
		z = min(y, MAX_Z); 
	end

## Variable Declarations

**Description:** Variables **SHOULD** be declared at the top of a function, even for variables that do not yet have a value.  

**Rationale:** Declaring variables at once improves readability, and pre-allocating memory to variables improves code performance 

DO:

	function [var1, var2, var3] = get_vars() 
		var1; % the first variable 
		var2; % the second variable 
		var3; % the third variable 
		var1 = 10 ; 
		var2 = var1^2; 
		var3 = var2 * 12; 
	end 

DON'T:

	function [var1, var2, var3] = get_vars() 
		var1 = 10 ; 
		var2 = var1^2; 
		var3 = var2 * 12; 
	end

## Magic Numbers

**Description:** Magic numbers **SHOULD NOT** be used in expressions. Define them as variables constants before using them. 

**Rationale:** This encourages reuse and documentation of numerical constants and improves overall readability.

DO:

	DECK_SIZE   = 52; 
	N_VALUES    = 13; 
	 
	for iPick = 1 : DECK_SIZE 
	    disp(randi(N_VALUES)); 
	end 

DON'T:

	for iPick = 1 : 52 
	    disp(randi(13)); 
	end 
 
## Function Calls Without Inputs

**Description:** Empty parentheses **SHOULD** be used for function calls without input arguments. 

**Rationale:** This helps to emphasize the fact that they are function calls and not variables or properties. 

DO:

	x = rand() * 2; 

DON'T:

	x = rand * 2;

## One Statement Per Line

**Description:** Each line **SHOULD** have at most one statement

**Rationale:** Maintain readability of your code by having each line of code do exactly one thing. 

**Exception:** One may declare a maximum of three variables on a single line if they are all of the same type or unit. One may place an if, for or while statement on one line if there is exactly one statement inside of the loop. 

DO:

	for iNode = 1 : 3 
	    x = x + iNode; 
	    disp(x); 
	end 
	 
	a = 1;  % Unitless 
	b = 2;  % Unitless 
	c = 3; % Unitless 
	disp(a + b + c); 
	 
	time_limit = 2; % [minutes] 
	time_start = 4; % [seconds] 
	time_stop = 9; % [seconds] 
	time_elapsed = time_stop - time_start; 

DON'T:

	for iNode = 1 : 3, x = x + iNode; disp(x); end 
	 
	a = 1;  % Unitless 
	b = 2;  % Unitless 
	c = 3; % Unitless 
	disp(a + b + c); 
	 
	time_limit = 2; % [minutes] 
	time_start = 4; % [seconds] 
	time_stop = 9; % [seconds] 
	time_elapsed = time_stop - time_start; 

EXCEPTIONS:

	% Variable declarations:
	persistent x, y; 
	 
	[a, b, c] = deal(1, 2, 3); 
	disp(a + b + c); 
	 
	time_limit = 2; % [minutes] 
	[time_start, time_stop] = deal(4, 9); % [seconds] 
	time_elapsed = time_stop - time_start; 
	 
	% One line loop: 
	for iNode = 1 : 3, x = x + iNode; end  % 1 statement inside loop is allowed 
 
## If/Else

**Description:** Every if **SHOULD** have an else section, even if it does not contain executable code. 

**Rationale:** By including an else section, no execution paths are overlooked. Additionally, code coverage can be accurately reported because without else, it is unclear whether the if-condition is ever false. 

DO:

	if x > 0 
	    saveData() 
	else 
	    % x does not indicate we want to save the dataset. 
	end 

DON'T:

	if x > 0 
	    saveData() 
	end

## Switch Otherwise

**Description:** Every switch **SHOULD** have an otherwise section, even if it does not contain executable code. 

**Rationale:** By including an otherwise section, no execution paths are overlooked. Additionally, code coverage can be accurately reported because without otherwise, it is unclear whether it happens that none of the cases occur. 

DO:

	switch reply 
	    case "Yes" 
	        saveData() 
	    case "No" 
	        clearData() 
	    otherwise 
	        % Should not get here. 
	        error("Unknown reply " + reply) 
	end 

DON'T:

	switch reply 
	    case "Yes" 
	        saveData() 
	    case "No" 
	        clearData() 
	end

## Mixed Types in Expressions

**Description:** Multiple operand types **SHOULD NOT** be used in a single operator. For example, do not mix logical and numerical operatonds with a multiplication operator. 

**Rationale:** Mixing operand types per operator can cause unexpected results and may lead to errors in case of true incompatibilities. 

DO:

	d = (a * b > 0) && c; 
 
DON'T:

	d = a * b && c;

## Parentheses in Logical Expressions

**Description:** Parentheses **SHOULD** be used to clarify the precedence of operands in expressions with multiple logical operators. No parentheses are required when only one type of logical operator is used. For example: d = a && b && c;. 

**Rationale:** By clarifying the precedence of the operands in such expressions, readability is improved and unexpected behaviour is prevented. 

DO:

	d = a && b || c;
 
DON'T:

	d = (a && b) || c; 

## Parentheses in Mathematical Expressions

**Description:** Parentheses **SHOULD** be used to clarify the precedence of operands in expressions with multiple mathematical operators. No parentheses are required when only one type of mathematical operator is used. For example: d = a * b * c;. 

**Rationale:** By clarifying the precedence of the operands in such expressions, readability is improved and unexpected behaviour is prevented. 

DO:

	d = (a * b) + c; 
	h = (f / 2) * g; 
 
DON'T:

	d = a * b + c; 
	h = f / 2 * g;

## Assert Inputs

**Description:** Every call to the built-in assert function **MUST** have an error identifier and a message as second and third inputs. 

**Rationale:** Including an identifier allows for better testing and exception handling. Including a proper error message directly clarifies the problem. 

DO:

	assert(~isempty(list), 'ClassName:MethodName:ListIsEmpty', 'The list shall not be empty.') 
 
DON'T:

	assert(~isempty(list))

## Global Variables

**Description:** The global keyword **SHOULD NOT** not be used. 

**Rationale:** The value of global variables can change from anywhere, which can make things unnecessarily complicated.

## Constant Conditional Statements

**Description:** Cconditions that are always true or always false, such as if true or elseif 0, **SHOULD NOT** be used. MATLAB's Code Analyzer warns about some of these cases. 

**Rationale:** These constructs may cause unreachable code or unintended behaviour. 

DO:

	disp(x)
DON'T:

	if x > 0 || true 
	    disp(x) 
	end    

## Struct for Related Entities

**Description:** A struct **SHOULD** be used to group together related entities. 

**Rationale:** Using a struct for related entities improves code organization. 

DO:

	Bpm.x 
	Bpm.y 
	Bpm.tmit 

DON'T:

	Bpm_x 
	Bpm_y 
	Bpm_tmit 

## Group Struct Field Definitions

**Description:** All fields of a struct **SHOULD** be defined in a single, contiguous block of code. No fields should be added to a struct after using it. 

**Rationale:** Lines of code or functions using the struct might assume that all fields are already there, resulting in an error if the field is not there. 

DO:

	s = struct("f", 2, "g", 3, "h", 'new field'); 
	 
	computeCost(s); 
 
DON'T:

	s = struct("f", 2, "g", 3); 
	 
	computeCost(s); 
	s.h = 'new field'; 
 
## Eval Functions

**Description:** The built-in eval function **SHOULD NOT** be used. Use of feval, evalin and evalc **SHOULD** be minimized.

**Rationale:** These functions can have harmful results and statements using them are usually difficult to read and maintain. 
Additionally, it may be overlooked when variables are defined or altered by calls to these functions.

## Keywords Break, Continue, and Return

**Description:** Use the keywords break, continue and return **SHOULD** be avoided. 

**Rationale:** Using break, continue or return decreases readability because the end of the function is not always reached. By avoiding these keywords, the flow of the code remains clear. However, these keywords can be useful to reduce complexity and improve performance. 

DO:

	if isempty(x) 
	    % No further actions. 
	else 
	    <rest of the code> 
	end  

DON'T:

	if isempty(x) 
	    return 
	end 
	 
	<rest of the code>

## Shell Escape

**Description:** The shell escape function **SHOULD NOT** be used. If necessary, use the system function instead. 

**Rationale:** When using the !program_to_execute syntax to execute external programs, no dynamic input or program names can be used. 

DO:

	system('mycommand') 
 
DON'T:

	!mycommand

**Description:** The try construct **SHOULD** only be used for exception handling. An exception object must be assigned or created and an error function must be called in the catch. Do not use try/catch to suppress errors or to express simple conditions. There are other, more suitable options for that. 

**Rationale:** Using try for simple error suppression can result in poor performance and unexpected behaviour. When a different error occurs than the one expected, it can go undetected because of the try/catch. 

DO:

	if isfield(container, 'nElements') 
	    nElems = container.nElements; 
	else 
	    nElems = 0; 
	end 
 
DON'T:

	try 
	    nElems = container.nElements; 
	catch 
	    nElems = 0; 
	end

## Floaitng-Point Comparisons

**Description:** Floating-point values **SHOULD NOT** be compared using == or ~=. Use a tolerance instead. 

**Rationale:** Rounding errors due to algorithm design or machine precision can cause unexpected inequalities. 

DO:

	out = abs(myFcn(in) - sqrt(3)) < 1e-12; 
DON'T:

	out = myFcn(in) == sqrt(3);
 
## Workspace Variable Ans

**Description:** The workspace variable ans **SHOULD NOT** be used.

**Rationale:** Use of the workspace variable ans reduces the robustness and security of the code. 

## Debugging Functions

**Description:** Debugging functions such as dbstep, dbcont, dbquit, keyboardor other functions that interact with the MATLAB debugger **SHOULD NOT** be used within a script. 

**Rationale:** These functions that interact with the MATLAB debugger reduce the robustness of the code. 

## Logical Indexing

**Description:** Logical indexing **SHOULD** be used instead of linear or subscript indexing where possible.

**Rationale:** Logical indexing is faster and more readable. 

DO:

	index = (v > MIN) & (v < MAX); 
 
DON'T

	index = intersect(find(v > MIN), find(v < MAX));
 
## Loop Vectorization

**Description:** Vectorization **SHOULD** be used to apply operations to arrays where feasible.

**Rationale:** Vectorized loops are faster, more robust, more readable, and more maintainable. 

DO:

	dataResult = dataset < limit; 
 
DON'T:

	dataResult = false(size(dataset)); 
	 
	for iElem = 1 : numel(dataset) 
	    if dataset(iElem) < limit(iElem) 
	        dataResult(iElem) = true; 
	    else 
	        dataResult(iElem) = false; 
	    end 
	end

## Zero Before Decimal Point

**Description:** A zero before the decimal point **SHOULD** be used in numeric expressions. 

**Rationale:** Increases the readability of the code. 

DO:

	THRESHOLD = 0.5;
DON'T:

	THRESHOLD = .5;

## Accessing Other Workspaces

**Description:** Functions accessing workspaces outside the scope of the current function, such as assignin, evalin, clc, **SHOULD NOT** be used within scripts. 

**Rationale:** These functions reduce the portability, robustness and readability of the code. 

## Use Switch Blocks

**Description:** A switch block **SHOULD** be used instead of many if-elseif-else statements when possible. 

**Rationale:** The notation of a switch block is more concise and therefore, more readable and easier to maintain. 

DO:

	switch name 
	    case "Bill" 
	        ... 
	    case {"Judith", "Bob"} 
	        ... 
	    case "Steve" 
	        ... 
	    otherwise 
	        ... 
	end 

DON'T:

	if name == "Bill" 
	    ... 
	elseif ismember(name, ["Judith", "Bob"]) 
	    ... 
	elseif name == "Steve" 
	    ... 
	else 
	    ... 
	end

# High Level Guidelines

## Complexity

**Description:** The number of lines of code and complexity of functions **SHOULD** be minimized as appropriate, especially for nested functions and methods in a classdef file. See standard on Single Responsibility below.

**Rationale:** Short functions are more likely to be readable, reusable and testable. 

## Number of Function Arguments

**Description:** The number of inputs and outputs of a function **SHOULD** be limited to five. If necessary, combine multiple arguments into a struct. 

**Rationale:** This helps prevent a long calling syntax, which in turn improves the readability and reusability of the code. 

DO:

	out = computeWeight(blockData, nBlocks, idx); 
 
DON'T:

	out = computeWeight(blockHeight, blockWidth, blockDepth, density, nBlocks, idx);

## Constructos with Single Output

**Description:** Every constructor **MUST** have exactly one output: an object of the class. 

**Rationale:** A second constructor output is unusual, so will be unexpected for readers of the code. 

DO:

	classdef Computer 
	    methods 
	        function obj = Computer(in) 
	            obj.value = in; 
	        end 
	    end 
	end 

DON'T:

	classdef Computer 
	    methods 
	        function [obj, out2] = Computer(in) 
	            obj.value = in; 
	            out2 = 2 * in; 
	        end 
	    end 
	end

## Scripts

**Description:** Functions **SHOULD** be used instead of scripts, even if there are no inputs or outputs. 

**Rationale:** The scope of variables in a script is not bounded as one might expect. It is therefore safer to use functions instead. Additionally, scripts are not compatible with Matlab Coder. 

## Editor Warnings

**Description:** Code Analyzer messages shown in the MATLAB editor **SHOULD** be prevented or suppressed. When the messages cannot be prevented, suppress them on an individual basis and add the reason in the comments. 

**Rationale:** The messages usually indicate that improvements can be made to the performance or stability of the code. Adding file-wide Code Analyzer suppressions is discouraged because new triggers of the messages may be overlooked. 

DO:

	%#ok<ABCDE> Suppress the Code Analyzer warning on this line alone. 
 
DON'T:

	%#ok<*ABCDE> Suppress a Code Analyzer warning in the entire file.

## Getters and Setters

**Description:** Dependent properties **SHOULD** not be used. Write explicit methods for getting or setting property values if necessary instead of get.<property> and set.<property>syntax.

**Rationale:** Property getters and setters can cause unexpected behaviour because code is run unexpectedly when the property's value is changed or requested. 

## Nesting Depth

**Description:** Clocks of code **SHOULD NOT** be nested deeper than ten levels. If necessary, refactor into multiple functions. When possible, keep nesting depth within 5.

**Rationale:** Deeply nested code is often less readable and it can be a sign of inefficient code. 

## Repeated Code

**Description:** If a function contains a block of code that is repeated more than one time, it **SHOULD** be refactored into a single function. 

**Rationale:** Refactoring of repeated blocks of code into single functions increases the maintainability, readability and reusability of the code. 

## Structure Ownership

**Description:** Ownership of a structure resides with the creator of that structure, so fields **SHOULD NOT** be added or removed from an existing structure outside of the function in which it was created. 

**Rationale:** Adding or removing fields from an existing structure outside of the function in which it was created reduces the robustness of the code. Related to coder compatibility, in generated code, adding a new field to a structure that has already been read or indexed will cause an error. 

DO:

	function [out] = calculateSpeed(car) 
	 
	out = car; 
	 
	% clear the field 
	car.speed = []; 

DON'T:

	function [out] = calculateSpeed(car) 
	 
	out = car; 
	 
	% do not remove fields from existing struct 
	car = rmfield(car, 'speed');

## Single Responsibility

**Description:** Single responsibility principle : all sub-functions and most functions **SHOULD** do one thing very well, and encapsulate a single idea. 

**Rationale:** The single responsibility principle makes code more readable, modular, and testable. Multi-purpose functions can often be split up into atomic units which are called on the input data in sequence. Functions should not try to be all things to all users. 

## Commented Out Code

**Description:** Commented-out lines of code **SHOULD** be removed.

**Rationale:** Removing commented-out code increases readability and it prevents someone from unintentionally enabling it again. 

## Reuse of Iterator Variables

**Description:** Iterator variables **SHOULD NOT** be reused within the same function. Limit the scope of an iterator variable to its for-loop. 

**Rationale:** Prevents renaming all iterators when only the one for a specific loop must be renamed. Also improves readability. 

DO:

	for iNode = 1 : numel(nodes) 
	    ... 
	end 
	 
	for iValue = 1 : 2 : 11 
	    ... 
	end 

DON'T:

	for iNode = 1 : numel(nodes) 
	    ... 
	end 
	 
	for iNode = 1 : 2 : 11 
	    ... 
	end


## Rewriting Existing Functions

**Description:** An existing function **SHOULD NOT** be copy-pasted as a local function of your code. Instead, use a wrapper around existing functionality. 

**Rationale:** Multiple forks, duplications and reinventions of the wheel make a code base less modular and less maintainable. 

## Columns with Implicit Meaning

**Description:** Matrices in which rows or columns have implicit meaning **SHOULD NOT** be used. Use individual vectors instead. 

**Rationale:** Using matrices with implicit row or column meanings reduces the readability and robustness of the code. 

DO:

	distance = sqrt(x .^ 2 + y .^ 2); 
 
DON'T:

	distance = sqrt(coordinates(:, 1) .^ 2 + coordinates(:, 2) .^ 2); 

## Nested Functions

**Description:** Use of nested functions **SHOULD** be minimized. Use only when really beneficial. 

**Rationale:** Nested functions reduce the readability and robustness of the code and can not be tested independently. 

## Input Parameter Dependency

**Description:** Function input arguments **SHOULD** be independent, and the function **SHOULD** not assume a dependency between them. 

**Rationale:** Assuming a dependency between independent input parameters reduces the robustness of the code. Conversely, if the inputs to a function are dependent, treating them as independent also reduces robustness. 

DO:

	function [meanV, meanA] = getMeanVandA(distances, timePts) 
		meanV      = sum(distances) ./ sum(timePts); 
		velocities = distances ./ timePts; 
		meanA      = velocities(end) ./ sum(timePts); 
		end 
	 
	function vectorOut = processVector(vectorIn) 
		for iIdx = 1 : length(vectorIn) 
		    vectorOut(ii) = processScalar(vectorIn(ii)); 
		end 
	end 

DON'T:

	function [meanV, meanA] = getMeanVandA(velocities, distances, timePts) 
		meanV = sum(distances) ./ sum(timePts); 
		meanA = velocities(end) ./ sum(timePts); 
	end 
	 
	function vectorOut = processVector(vectorIn, vectorLength) 
		for iIdx = 1 : vectorLength 
		    vectorOut(ii) = processScalar(vectorIn(ii)); 
		end 
	end

## Java Dependency

**Description:** Code **SHOULD** be independent of Java and therefore **SHOULD NOT** have Java dependencies, dependencies such as: javacomponent, javaMethod, javaObjectEDTetc. 

**Rationale:** Java packages and subpackages will not be available in MATLAB in a future release. 

# Standards for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)

## Error Handling

**Description:** Callback functions **MUST** have all their code in a try/catch loop, and follow appropriate error handling methods.

**Rationale:** Proper error handling prevents an application from crashing.

## Separable Models

**Description:** Model classes **SHOULD** be able to run without the GUI itself. Consider the separate aspects of a model, including service logic, service configuration, and application state management.

**Rationale:** Separable models allow for service logic to be run without the overhead of the GUI, increasing the usability of code across multiple platforms.

## Resizing

**Description:** GUIs **MUST** be resizable for personal computers. Consider using grid layouts to ensure resizability.

**Rationale:** The size of a GUI may vary between an individual's personal computer, and an operator interface in the control room. GUIs should be usable on both.

## GUI Documentation

**Description:** GUIs **MUST** have documentation explaining their use, as well as their design.

**Rationale:** Usage documentation allows users to learn how to use a GUI, and design documentation allows other developers to contribute to and maintain code.

## Documentation Links

**Description:** GUIs **MUST** have a component linking to documentation.

**Rationale:** This allows users to easily access documentation.

## Machine State Indication

**Description:** GUIs **SHOULD** indicate the state of the machine with which they are interaction, in particular which beam line.

**Rationale:** This makes clear what will happen when GUI actions are taken.

## Print To Log

**Description:** GUIs **SHOULD** have a print to log button that automatically saves its data.

**Rationale:** This ensures control or analysis using a GUI can be tracked by SLAC elogs, and that data is available to recreate figures.

## Data Save Location

**Description:** Data **SHOULD** be saved using the following format: $MATLABDATAFILES/YYYY/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD, where $MATLABDATAFILES is an environment variable indicating the root directory for saving data. For example, on a production network, /u1/lcls/matlab/data/2023/2023-07/2023-07-18 for files saved on July 18th, 2023. Consider using the util_dataSave function to take care of this.

**Rationale:** This is the default data directory for SLAC AD LCLS work.

## Tooltips

**Description:** GUIs **SHOULD** have tooltips that explain what components do.

**Rationale:** Tooltips make GUIs easier to use.

## Style Guide

**Description:** GUIs **SHOULD** conform to the style guide detailed <u>here</u>. (Style guide to be inserted)

**Rationale:** The style guide specifies best practices for user experience.
